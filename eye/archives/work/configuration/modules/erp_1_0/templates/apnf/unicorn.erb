#before_fork do |server, worker|
# This option works in together with preload_app true setting
# What is does is prevent the master process from holding
# the database connection
#  defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
#    ActiveRecord::Base.connection.disconnect!
#end

#after_fork do |server, worker|
# Here we are establishing the connection after forking worker
# processes
#  defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
#    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
