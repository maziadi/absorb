UDEV
----

For Linux kernel 2.6 and newer, the udev system provides mechanism for the automatic hardware discovery and initialization.
    > If "/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/modules.dep" was not generated properly by depmod(8) for some reason, modules
    may not be loaded as expected by the udev system. Execute "depmod -a" to fix it.
    > If you want to avoid some kernel modules to be auto-loaded, consider to blacklist them in the 
    "/etc/modprobes.d/blacklist" file

AUTHENTICATION
--------------
    > "/etc/gshadow" provides the similar function as "/etc/shadow" for "/etc/group" but is not really used.

    > Modern Unix-like systems such as the Debian system provide PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) 
    and NSS (Name Service Switch) mechanism to the local system administrator to configure his system.
    The role of these can be summarizes as the following.
      PAM offers a flexible authentication mechanism used by the application software thus involves password data exchange.
      NSS offers a flexible name service mechanism which is frequently used by the C standard library to obtain the user
      and group name for programs such as ls(1) and id(1).

TCP/UDP PORT NUMBERS
--------------------
    > de 0 à 65535
    > The combination of IP address, port and protocol is called a socket, and has to be unique for every service.
    The port numbers area available for both TCP and UDP, and when referred to in conjunction with the IP address
    it specifies the "socket"

    insecure service name  port  secure service name   port
    www (http)              80   https                 443

SECURING THE ROOT PASSWORD
--------------------------
To prevent people to access your machine with root privilege, you need to make following actions.

  > Prevent physical access to the hard disk
  > Lock BIOS and prevent booting from the removable media
  > Set password for GRUB interactive session
  > Lock GRUB menu from editing

With physical access to hard disk, resetting the password is relatively easy with following steps.

  > Move the hard disk to a PC with CD bootable BIOS.
  > Boot system with a rescue media (Debian boot disk, Knoppix CD, GRUB CD, …).
  > Mount root partition with read/write access.
  > Edit "/etc/passwd" in the root partition and make the second entry for the root account empty.

If you have edit access to the GRUB menu entry (see Section 3.1.2, “Stage 2: the boot loader”) for grub-rescue-pc at boot time, it is even easier with following steps.

  > Boot system with the kernel parameter changed to something like "root=/dev/hda6 rw init=/bin/sh".
  > Edit "/etc/passwd" and make the second entry for the root account empty.
  > Reboot system.

The root shell of the system is now accessible without password.


LVM
---
LVM requires the following.

  > Device-mapper support in the Linux kernel (default for Debian kernels)
  > The userspace device-mapper support library (libdevmapper* package)
  > The userspace LVM2 tools (lvm2 package)

Btrfs filesystem is available in Linux kernel 3.2 (Debian wheezy). It is expected to be the next default filesystem 
after the ext4 filesystem.
