UDEV

For Linux kernel 2.6 and newer, the udev system provides mechanism for the automatic hardware discovery and initialization.
    > If "/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/modules.dep" was not generated properly by depmod(8) for some reason, modules
    may not be loaded as expected by the udev system. Execute "depmod -a" to fix it.
    > If you want to avoid some kernel modules to be auto-loaded, consider to blacklist them in the 
    "/etc/modprobes.d/blacklist" file

AUTHENTICATION

    > "/etc/gshadow" provides the similar function as "/etc/shadow" for "/etc/group" but is not really used.

    > Modern Unix-like systems such as the Debian system provide PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) 
    and NSS (Name Service Switch) mechanism to the local system administrator to configure his system.
    The role of these can be summarizes as the following.
      PAM offers a flexible authentication mechanism used by the application software thus involves password data exchange.
      NSS offers a flexible name service mechanism which is frequently used by the C standard library to obtain the user
      and group name for programs such as ls(1) and id(1).
